    "Sometimes you might not want to create objects form a class, but just derive other classes from it, as they share some attributes. F.ex. you create a \"Reader\"-class that contains read data in a specified form (such as a feature matrix and target vector), but the data could be read from different sources, requiring different methods to actually read that data. The Reader-baseclass would never need to be instantiated (and also shouldn't, as it would have no way of reading data and therefore no use). A class like this is called _abstract_. To create an abstract base class (or ABC), python provides the module _abc_. Every class that should not be instantiated, has to be derived from the _ABC_-class and contain at least one _abstractmethod_ - a method that is there, but only really defined in the derived classes."
